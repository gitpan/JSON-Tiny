An initial Perl 6 grammar for JSON.

This is a work in progress. For more information please join #perl6 on
irc.freenode.net, and talk to moritz_ or viklund, or write a mail to
perl6-users@perl.org.

documentation, in tests or distributed as separate files) can be considered

State:

    The parser is pretty complete, if you find anything that it should
    parse and doesn't, or the other way round, please let me know.

    The emitter works.
